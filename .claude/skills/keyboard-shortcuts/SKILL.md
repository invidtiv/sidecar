# Keyboard Shortcuts

Complete shortcut listings and context reference for all sidecar plugins. For implementation patterns, see `docs/guides/deprecated/ui-feature-guide.md`. For a detailed assessment of inconsistencies, vim alignment, mnemonic quality, and improvement proposals, see `references/assessment.md` in this skill directory.

## Architecture

- **Centralized binding registry**: `internal/keymap/bindings.go` is the single source of truth for key bindings.
- **Context-based dispatch**: Each plugin defines contexts; bindings are scoped to contexts.
- **Command palette** (`?`): Auto-discovers bindings for discoverability.
- **User overrides**: Supported via `~/.config/sidecar/config.json`.
- **Key sequences**: Compound commands like `g g` are supported with 500ms timeout.

### Adding a New Shortcut

1. Add the binding in `internal/keymap/bindings.go` under the appropriate context.
2. Add command handling in the plugin's `Update()` method (usually in a `handlers.go` file).
3. Add the command to the plugin's `Commands()` method for footer hint and command palette.
4. Keep command names short (1 word preferred) to prevent footer wrapping.

### TD Monitor Shortcuts

TD shortcuts are dynamically exported from TD itself via `ExportBindings()` and `ExportCommands()` in `pkg/monitor/keymap/`. TD is the single source of truth. To add TD shortcuts:

1. Add binding to TD's `pkg/monitor/keymap/bindings.go`
2. Add command constant to TD's `pkg/monitor/keymap/registry.go`
3. Add metadata to TD's `pkg/monitor/keymap/export.go`
4. Handle in TD's `pkg/monitor/model.go`

## Global Shortcuts

| Key | Command | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `j` / `down` | cursor-down | Move cursor down |
| `k` / `up` | cursor-up | Move cursor up |
| `G` | cursor-bottom | Jump to bottom |
| `g g` | cursor-top | Jump to top |
| `ctrl+d` | page-down | Page down |
| `ctrl+u` | page-up | Page up |
| `enter` | select | Select item |
| `esc` | back | Go back / close |
| `` ` `` | next-plugin | Next header entry |
| `~` | prev-plugin | Previous header entry |
| `]` | next-plugin | Next header entry |
| `[` | prev-plugin | Previous header entry |
| `1`-`7` | focus-plugin-N | Focus the Nth project tab (positional; stops at 7) |
| `8` | focus-sessions | Sessions (global) |
| `9` | focus-activity | Activity (global) |
| `0` | focus-tasks | Tasks (global; no-op when the Tasks host is disabled) |
| `?` | toggle-palette | Command palette |
| `!` | toggle-diagnostics | Diagnostics overlay |
| `@` | switch-project | Project switcher |
| `W` | switch-worktree | Worktree switcher |
| `#` | switch-theme | Theme switcher |
| `,` | open-configuration | Open Configuration (contexts that bind `,` win) |
| `i` | open-issue | Open issue |
| `r` | refresh | Refresh |
| `q` | quit | Quit (root contexts only) |
| `ctrl+c` | quit | Force quit |

### The header row is one ring

Sidecar's header is a single row of entries: the global ones in the left cluster
(Sessions, Activity, and Tasks when its feature is on) followed by the project's
plugin tabs on the right.

`[` / `]` (and their `~` / `` ` `` aliases) wrap through **all** of it, in that
order, and the ring is identical from either scope — the project tabs are
painted only in project scope, but they stay in the ring from the global space
so the cycle is never a trap and `]` then `[` is always the identity. Tasks is
absent from the ring whenever its feature is off.

The number row addresses the same row, but by two different rules:

- `1`-`7` are **positional** project tabs. They stop at 7. An eighth plugin tab
  is reached with `[` / `]` or from the command palette.
- `8` / `9` / `0` are **named** global entries — Sessions, Activity, Tasks — and
  mean the same thing in every scope. A key whose entry is disabled (`0` with
  the Tasks host off) does nothing at all, silently; it never falls through to a
  plugin tab.

All ten digits and the four cycling keys are in `keymap.GlobalKeys`, so no
plugin may claim them, and all of them yield to a focused text input.

## Configuration (`config` / `config-edit` / `config-confirm` contexts)

Opened with `,` or by clicking the header gear, always on Sidecar Setup. Like the Overview,
Configuration covers the plugin pane and owns keyboard focus: unhandled keys are swallowed
rather than leaking to the hidden plugin. `?` still opens the command palette.

| Key | Command | Context | Action |
|-----|---------|---------|--------|
| `j` / `k` / `up` / `down` | cursor-down / cursor-up | config | Move through sidebar destinations |
| `enter` | select | config | Open the selected destination |
| `/` | search | config | Focus Search (enters `config-edit`) |
| `tab` | focus-search | config | Move focus between sidebar and Search |
| `esc` | close-configuration | config | Return from a child route, else close and restore the prior surface |
| `down` | first-result | config-edit | Move from Search to the first visible result |
| `up` | focus-search | config-edit | Return to Search from the first result |
| `esc` | clear-search | config-edit | Clear the query and restore the full sidebar |
| `enter` / `y` | confirm | config-confirm | Confirm a consequential change |
| `esc` / `n` | cancel | config-confirm | Cancel it |

## Agent Overview (`overview` context)

Opened with `K` or by clicking the Sidecar logo. The Overview covers the plugin pane and
owns keyboard focus: a plugin left in interactive/text-input mode underneath it (embedded
shell, inline editor) does not receive keys while it is open, and unhandled keys are
swallowed rather than leaking to the hidden plugin.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `h` / `l` / `left` / `right` | Move between lanes |
| `j` / `k` / `up` / `down` | Move within a lane |
| `enter` | Open the selected workspace (switches project) |
| `r` | Refresh the board |
| `esc` / `K` | Close the Overview |
| `q` | Quit Sidecar (confirmation modal) |

Global shortcuts stay live while it is open: `` ` ``/`~`, `[`/`]`, `1-9`, `@`, `#`, `W`, `?`, `!`,
`^`, `i`, `ctrl+c`, `q`. Plugin-switching keys (`` ` ``, `~`, `1-9`) close the Overview first.
`esc` on the Agents board or Workspaces list leaves the global space. `q` opens Sidecar's quit modal.

## Global Workspaces

Contexts: `global-workspaces` (list, root), `global-workspaces-filter`, `global-workspaces-rename`, `global-workspaces-create`, `global-workspaces-delete`, `global-workspaces-terminal` (typing), `global-workspaces-doc`, `global-workspaces-doc-search`, `global-workspaces-doc-find`, `global-workspaces-issue`, `global-workspaces-diff`.

There is no watched-preview focus: hiding the sidebar is layout only. `l` / `→` do not move focus to the preview. Clicking a file or td id focuses a content leaf with its own context; footer, help, and the palette follow `WorkspaceFocusContext()`.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` / arrows / `g` / `G` | Move selection; preview follows; not typing |
| `enter` / `E` | Start typing in the selected live pane. A dead row stays put |
| click in pane | Start typing. Clicking Diff/Task action chips opens a leaf and does not type |
| click a file tab | Select that file in the document preview. `{` / `}` also cycle when the document is focused |
| click an issue tab | Select that issue in the issue preview. `{` / `}` also cycle when the issue is focused |
| click a list row | Select it; preview follows; not typing |
| click another row while typing | Switch session and stay typing |
| double-click a row | Open that identity in its owning project |
| wheel on terminal | Scroll only; do not activate |
| `ctrl+\` / `esc esc` | Stop typing and land on the list |
| `ctrl+shift+f` while typing | Search the complete terminal history |
| `i` | Find TD task (`open-issue`). Not interactive |
| `n` | Open Create Workspace (Worktree) |
| `ctrl+n` | Open Create Workspace with Shell selected (modal) |
| `D` | Delete the selected shell (shown only for shell rows) |
| `m` | Open the owning project's established merge strategy workflow for a safe worktree |
| `/` | Filter |
| `v` / `s` | Open View: sort the list. `v` matches the project sidebar; `s` is the original alias |
| `\` | Toggle sidebar |
| `esc` | Leave the global space (or clear the filter first) |
| `q` | Quit Sidecar (confirmation modal) |
| `K` | Toggle the global space |
| `M` | Open the reposition modal on the focused pane, or on the selected row's Primary terminal from the list (`pane_move`) |

`ctrl+]` attach stays project-only and is off unless `tmux_full_attach` is enabled. While typing, `i` and `q` go to the pane.

### Focused document (`global-workspaces-doc`)

Same keys as the project document pane: `q`/`esc` close, `x` close tab,
`{`/`}` cycle tabs, `m` toggle render, `Y` yank path — and the same three
searches, all rooted at the pane's own directory: `/` in-file search,
`ctrl+p` file finder, `f` project search. The finder and project search are
`internal/panesearch`; the in-file bar is `internal/docview`. Contexts while
one is up: `global-workspaces-doc-search` and `global-workspaces-doc-find`.

### Focused issue (`global-workspaces-issue`)

An unmodified click on a `td-…` link opens it beside the terminal. A
second click appends a tab; an already-open ID is focused. Click a
drawn tab to select it. The header is only the tab strip: ID plus
headline, truncated at the end so the ID stays visible. Footer hints
are Tab× Tab← Tab→. There is no close chip.

`enter` on a parent or subtask uses the same open-or-focus path (no
duplicate, no silent replace). Tabs stay in memory for the selected
row and are not written to disk.

| Key | Command | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `enter` | open-item | Open or focus the selected parent or subtask as a tab |
| `O` | open-in-td | Open the selected issue in td (same jump as the preview modal's `o`) |
| `x` | close-tab | Close the active tab. Last tab closes the pane and forgets the set |
| `{` / `}` | prev-tab / next-tab | Previous / next issue tab |
| `y` | yank-issue | Copy issue as markdown |
| `Y` | yank-issue-key | Copy issue ID |
| `q` / `esc` | close | Close the pane and forget this row's in-memory tabs |

### Project issue pane (`workspace-issue`)

Same open/append/click/cycle/close journey and the same `{` / `}` / `x`
/ yank / enter keys. `tab` / `shift+tab` cycle panes; `\` toggles the
sidebar. `q` / `esc` hide the pane and retain tabs for that surface;
last `x` forgets. Switching shells or relaunching restores tabs, the
active tab, and each tab's scroll.

| Key | Command | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `enter` | open-item | Open or focus the selected parent or subtask as a tab |
| `O` | open-in-td | Open the selected issue in td (same jump as the preview modal's `o`) |
| `x` | close-tab | Close the active tab. Last tab forgets the pane |
| `{` / `}` | prev-tab / next-tab | Previous / next issue tab |
| `y` | yank-issue | Copy issue as markdown |
| `Y` | yank-issue-key | Copy issue ID |
| `tab` / `shift+tab` | next-pane / prev-pane | Move focus between sidebar, terminal, document, and issue |
| `\` | toggle-sidebar | Toggle sidebar visibility |
| `q` / `esc` | close | Hide the pane. Tabs stay remembered for this surface |

## Sidebar Controls (All Two-Pane Plugins)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Switch focus between panes |
| `\` | Toggle sidebar visibility |
| `h` / `left` | Focus left pane |
| `l` / `right` | Focus right pane |
| `+` | Grow sidebar width |
| `-` | Shrink sidebar width |

## Git Status Plugin

### Contexts

| Context | View |
|---------|------|
| `git-status` | File list (root) |
| `git-status-commits` | Recent commits sidebar (root) |
| `git-status-diff` | Inline diff pane (root) |
| `git-commit-preview` | Commit detail in right pane |
| `git-diff` | Full-screen diff |
| `git-commit` | Commit editor |
| `git-push-menu` | Push strategy selection |
| `git-pull-menu` | Pull strategy selection |
| `git-pull-conflict` | Conflict resolution |
| `git-history` | Commit history |
| `git-commit-detail` | Single commit view |

### File List Shortcuts

| Key | Command | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `s` | stage-file | Stage selected file |
| `u` | unstage-file | Unstage selected file |
| `S` | stage-all | Stage all modified |
| `U` | unstage-all | Unstage all |
| `c` | commit | Open commit editor |
| `A` | amend | Amend last commit |
| `d` / `enter` | show-diff | View file changes |
| `D` | discard-changes | Discard unstaged changes |
| `h` | show-history | Open commit history |
| `P` | push | Open push menu |
| `L` | pull | Open pull menu |
| `f` | fetch | Fetch from remote |
| `b` | branch | Branch operations |
| `z` | stash | Stash changes |
| `Z` | stash-pop | Pop stash |
| `ctrl+z` | stash-apply | Stash apply |
| `o` | open-in-github | Open in GitHub |
| `O` | open-in-file-browser | Open in file browser |
| `y` | yank-file | Copy file info |
| `Y` | yank-path | Copy file path |

### Inline Diff Pane (`git-status-diff`)

The right-hand pane of the Git tab, focused with `enter` / `l` from the file
list.

| Key | Command | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `j` / `k` | scroll-down / scroll-up | Scroll the diff |
| `ctrl+d` / `ctrl+u` | page-down / page-up | Scroll half a page |
| `g` / `G` | — | Jump to start (also resets the horizontal axis) / end |
| `h` / `l` | — | Scroll horizontally; `h` at column 0 returns to the sidebar |
| `\|` | reset-hscroll | Snap the horizontal scroll back to column 0 |
| `enter` | full-diff | Open the full-screen diff |
| `s` / `u` | stage-file / unstage-file | Stage / unstage the file |
| `v` | toggle-diff-view | Cycle unified → split → full-file |
| `w` | toggle-wrap | Toggle line wrap |
| `\` | toggle-sidebar | Toggle the sidebar |
| `+` / `-` | resize-pane-grow / resize-pane-shrink | Resize the split |

`|` is vim's goto-column key. It reads as the odd choice next to vim's `0`, and
`0` is what this pane used to bind — but the whole number row belongs to the
header (see "The header row is one ring"), so `0` never reaches the plugin. It
was a live handler that had quietly stopped being reachable; `|` is the
replacement, and unlike `0` it is registered, so it appears in the footer and
in `?`.

### Full-Screen Diff (`git-diff`)

| Key | Command | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `,` / `.` | prev-file / next-file | Previous / next changed file |
| `s` / `u` | stage-file / unstage-file | Stage / unstage the file on screen |
| `v` | toggle-diff-view | Cycle the diff view mode |
| `w` | toggle-wrap | Toggle line wrap |
| `y` | yank-diff | Copy the diff |
| `c` | commit | Open the commit editor |
| `q` / `esc` | close-diff | Leave the diff |

This view has no tabs, so `{` / `}` are deliberately unbound here rather than
made to mean "next file" — that would be the one place in Sidecar where a brace
did something other than cycle tabs, and a silent wrong action is worse than a
no-op. File stepping is `,` / `.`, the same as in the Workspaces Diff pane.

### Commit List Shortcuts

| Key | Command | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `enter` / `d` | view-commit | Open commit details |
| `h` | show-history | Open history view |
| `y` | yank-commit | Copy commit as markdown |
| `Y` | yank-id | Copy commit hash |
| `/` | search-history | Search commit messages |
| `f` | filter-author | Filter by author |
| `p` | filter-path | Filter by path |
| `F` | clear-filter | Clear filters |
| `n` | next-match | Next search match |
| `N` | prev-match | Previous match |
| `o` | open-in-github | Open commit in GitHub |
| `v` | toggle-graph | Toggle commit graph |

### Pull Menu

| Key | Command |
|-----|---------|
| `p` | pull-merge |
| `r` | pull-rebase |
| `f` | pull-ff-only |
| `a` | pull-autostash |

## File Browser Plugin

### Contexts

| Context | View |
|---------|------|
| `file-browser-tree` | Tree view (root) |
| `file-browser-preview` | Preview pane |
| `file-browser-search` | Filename search |
| `file-browser-content-search` | Content search |
| `file-browser-quick-open` | Fuzzy file finder |
| `file-browser-project-search` | Ripgrep search modal |
| `file-browser-file-op` | File operation input |
| `file-browser-inline-edit` | Inline vim editor (all keys forwarded, global shortcuts bypassed) |

### Tree Shortcuts

| Key | Command | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `/` | search | Filter files by name |
| `ctrl+p` | quick-open | Find — a file by name (same key, same name as a workspace file pane) |
| `f` | project-search | Search — the project's contents (ripgrep) |
| `/` (preview) | search-content | InFile — this file's contents |
| `a` | create-file | Create new file |
| `A` | create-dir | Create new directory |
| `d` | delete | Delete (with confirmation) |
| `t` | new-tab | Open in new tab |
| `{` | prev-tab | Previous tab |
| `}` | next-tab | Next tab |
| `x` | close-tab | Close active tab |
| `y` | yank | Copy to clipboard |
| `p` | paste | Paste from clipboard |
| `s` | sort | Cycle sort mode |
| `m` | move | Move file/directory |
| `R` | rename | Rename |
| `ctrl+r` | reveal | Reveal in file manager |

A file opened in an app content pane beside Files uses the shared `workspace-doc` document context. It keeps the same file-facing shortcuts as the primary Files preview wherever the shared viewer owns the capability: `/` InFile, `ctrl+p` Find, `f` Search, `e` inline Edit, `E` external Editor, `r` Reload, `m` Render, `w` Wrap, `I` Info, `ctrl+r` Reveal, `y` Contents, `Y` Path, configured selection copy/select-all, `{` / `}` tabs, and `+` / `-` resize. Its finder and project search are the same `internal/panesearch` surfaces used by project and global Workspace document panes, rooted at that content deck's project and loading results back into the focused pane. Files-only tree operations such as rename and its full-screen blame mode remain owned by the primary Files surface; they are not document-viewer shortcuts and are not forwarded to a potentially different file behind the focused pane.

## Conversations Plugin

### Contexts

| Context | View |
|---------|------|
| `conversations` | Session list single-pane (root) |
| `conversations-sidebar` | Session list two-pane (root) |
| `conversations-main` | Messages pane |
| `conversations-search` | Search mode |
| `conversations-filter` | Adapter filter |
| `conversation-detail` | Turn list |
| `message-detail` | Single turn content |
| `analytics` | Usage stats |

|---------|------|
| `workspace-list` | Workspace list (root) |
| `workspace-preview` | Preview pane |
| `workspace-doc` | File tabs beside the terminal (hide with `q`) |

| `workspace-doc-find` | A pane's in-file search bar (owns the keyboard) |
| `workspace-doc-edit` | A pane's inline editor (owns every key, ctrl+c included) |
| `workspace-issue` | Issue tabs beside the terminal (hide with `q`; last `x` forgets) |
| `workspace-diff` | Diff tabs beside the terminal (hide with `q`; last `x` forgets) |
| `workspace-create` | Create Workspace form |
| `workspace-task-link` | Task selection modal |
| `workspace-merge` | Merge workflow modal |
| `workspace-interactive` | Embedded terminal |

### List Shortcuts

| Key | Command | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `n` | new-workspace | Open Create Workspace (Worktree) |
| `ctrl+n` | new-shell | Create a new shell immediately (shadows the global `ctrl+n` cursor-down in this context) |
| `v` | open-view | Open View: sort the list (Manual, Activity, Recent, Name) |
| `V` | toggle-view | Toggle list/kanban |
| `D` | delete-workspace | Delete workspace / delete shell (confirm) |
| `d` | show-diff | Open working-tree Diff leaf |
| `p` | push | Push branch |
| `m` | merge-workflow | Start merge workflow |

| `t` | attach | Full tmux attach (`tmux_full_attach`, default off) |
| `S` | stop-agent | Stop agent |
| `F` | find-file | Open a file pane on the fuzzy file finder |
| `P` | fetch-pr | Fetch a remote PR as a workspace |
| `M` | move-pane | Open the reposition modal on the selected row's Primary terminal (`pane_move`) |


### Preview Shortcuts

| Key | Command | Action |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `o` | open-pane | Open the pane switcher (kind list focused) without leaving the preview |
| `d` | show-diff | Open working-tree Diff leaf |
| `ctrl+t` | toggle-terminal | Toggle a terminal split beside the preview |
| `M` | move-pane | Open the reposition modal on the focused pane (`pane_move`) |

### The Pane Switcher Is Reachable From Every Pane

`n` opens the pane switcher whenever a **content pane** has focus — Document,
Issue, Note, Diff or Resource — on both the project workspace
(`workspace-doc|issue|note|diff|resource`) and the global Workspaces browser
(`global-workspaces-doc|issue|note|diff|resource`). Every content pane absorbs
the keys it does not own, so without this the switcher was reachable only from
the sidebar or the terminal: putting a second pane beside the one you were
reading meant leaving it first.

`n` is the same key the sidebar and the terminal preview already answer with
"make me a new thing", so the answer does not change with focus. Two
consequences follow, and both are deliberate:

- The **Diff pane's** `n` / `N` next-change pair moved to `>` / `<` — the
  shifted forms of its `,` / `.` file steps, so the pair reads as one
  hierarchy: step a file, shift to step a change inside it. One key means one
  thing in every pane; a key that meant next-change here and "new pane"
  everywhere else is exactly the drift this codebase refuses.
- A **live input surface inside a pane still wins**. A committed in-file
  search owns `n` for its next-match while it is up, as does the doc editor
  and the finder overlay; the switcher is asked only after they decline.

The terminal preview keeps `o` rather than `n`, because `n` there belongs to
the list's create. `internal/keymap`'s parity tests hold both surfaces to the
same key in the same contexts.

#### The plugin half: `ctrl+n`

The same entry exists in the ordinary plugins, under `ctrl+n` rather than `n`.
Every plugin that has a create already spends `n` on it — `new-note`,
`next-match` — so displacing those would be the drift the Workspaces half
deliberately avoided.

It is bound in **one place** for all five plugins: `internal/app/pane_switcher.go`,
not once per plugin. The deck the switcher opens into is the app's
(`internal/app/content_deck.go`) and so is the key routing, so a plugin opts in
simply by being deck-eligible — implementing `plugin.ContentLinkProvider` and
`plugin.PaneFocusProvider`, with `features.PluginContentPanes` on. Today that is
`file-browser`, `git-status`, `notes`, `tasks` and `td-monitor`; `workspace` is
excluded because it owns its own pane tree.

Three rules decide where the key appears, and none of them is a per-plugin list:

- **The keymap is the whole opt-in.** The host reads the entry key out of the
  keymap for whatever context is active (`paneSwitcherKeyFor`) rather than
  comparing against a constant. A context that never names `open-pane` never
  reaches the switcher, and a user who rebinds `open-pane` moves the key *and*
  its footer hint together.
- **Browse and preview contexts only.** `ctrl+n` is `cursor-down` in the global
  context and in every filter, finder, search and editor context. Claiming it
  where it already walks a list would take the cursor out from under someone who
  is typing, so those contexts keep it. See the assignment table below.
- **A focused passive leaf answers `n`, not `ctrl+n`.** A leaf inside a plugin's
  deck reports the same `workspace-doc|issue|note|diff|resource` context the two
  Workspaces surfaces report for the same pane, so it answers the same key
  there. One model, three projections, one key each.

The switcher offers **pane kinds only** outside Workspaces — File, Git diff,
td issue, Note, one row per configured resource provider — and is titled
"Open Pane" rather than "Create Workspace". Shell and Worktree create workspace
rows, which a Notes plugin has nowhere to put; Terminal split is absent because
a plugin deck is a passive `contentpanes` deck with no live-leaf host. That is
`workspacecreate.OpenOpts.PaneKindsOnly` plus `AllowTerminalSplit: false` — the
same data-driven catalog, one more flag, no second modal.

See `docs/plans/active/pane-switcher-everywhere.md`.

#### Where `ctrl+n` goes, in full

Every context that binds `ctrl+n` in `keymap.DefaultBindings()`, and to what.
`internal/keymap/pane_switcher_parity_test.go` holds this table to the tree.

| Context | Command | Why |
|---------|---------|-----|
| `global` | `cursor-down` | The emacs/readline default. Everything below either shadows it or inherits it. |
| `notes-list` | `open-pane` | Notes' browse context. |
| `file-browser-tree`, `file-browser-preview` | `open-pane` | The File Browser's two browse contexts. |
| `git-status`, `git-status-commits`, `git-status-diff`, `git-diff`, `git-commit-preview` | `open-pane` | Git names both the focused pane and the cursor's row in its context, so reading a file row, reading a commit and reading a diff are three contexts. |
| `tasks-list`, `tasks-detail`, `tasks-response`, `tasks-response-detail` | `open-pane` | Exactly Tasks' four root contexts; everything else Tasks reports is an overlay it owns the keyboard in. |
| `td-monitor`, `td-board`, `td-kanban` | `open-pane` | td's three browse views: the main list, board mode, the kanban view. |
| `global-workspaces`, `workspace-list` | `new-shell` | The Workspaces lists' second create. This is the precedent `ctrl+n` follows here — one modifier out from `n`, same intent. |
| `global-workspaces-filter`, `project-switcher` | `cursor-down` | Filters. The key walks the list while you type. |
| `file-browser-quick-open`, `file-browser-project-search` | `cursor-down` | Finders. |
| `notes-search`, `notes-editor` | `cursor-down` | Search and the built-in editor. |

Contexts deliberately **without** a row, and the reason each is different:

- `notes-preview` — the note preview answers `ctrl+n`/`ctrl+p` as its own cursor
  motion in plugin code (`notes.handleEditorPreviewKey`), with nothing in
  `bindings.go` to show for it. The rule stands aside; Notes stays reachable
  from `notes-list`.
- `td-modal` and its sub-focus states (`td-epic-tasks`, `td-parent-epic`,
  `td-blocked-by-focused`, `td-blocks-focused`) — `tdmonitor.BlocksGlobalKeys`
  hands every key in that context to the embedded td model at precedence level
  2, two rungs above the switcher's, so a binding there would never fire. This
  is the one genuinely wanted pane the entry does not reach.
- `td-search`, `td-form`, `td-board-editor`, `td-confirm`, `td-close-confirm`,
  and every non-root `tasks-*` context — text input or an overlay the plugin
  forwards wholesale.
- `git-history` — has bindings in `bindings.go` but `gitstatus.FocusContext()`
  never reports it. A binding on a context nobody stands in is a key that does
  nothing.
- Anything reaching a **live PTY**. `ctrl+n` is a real control character:
  `tty.MapKeyToTmux` encodes it as `C-n` and sends it to the pane. The tty
  layer's own chords are `ctrl+\` (exit), `ctrl+]` (attach), `alt+c` (copy),
  `alt+v` (paste), `ctrl+a` (select all) and the platform copy chord; its
  scrollback set is the arrows plus the `j/k/g/G/ctrl+d/ctrl+u` pager aliases.
  The two host `OnKey` hooks claim only terminal search and `ctrl+t`. Above all
  of that, `workspace-interactive`, `file-browser-inline-edit`,
  `notes-inline-edit` and `workspace-doc-edit` forward every key two rungs
  before the switcher's is reached.

`g` / `G` jump to the top / bottom of the preview's scrollback. `0` is
deliberately **not** bound here: it is the header's global Tasks shortcut, and a
context-local binding would make the same key mean two different things one tab
apart. (It previously carried a `reset-scroll` command that had no handler
anywhere in the tree.)

### `M` Opens the Reposition Modal From Every Pane

`M` (`move-pane`, feature `pane_move`, default on) opens the shared pane reposition modal — the same modal the pane header's `⊞` button opens, and the same one for all three pane hosts. It is an entry point, not a second interaction: `M` never mutates the live tree by itself. Inside the modal, `h/j/k/l` and the arrows edit a draft, `z` toggles zoom, `enter` commits the whole sequence atomically, and `esc` discards it.

**Which pane it targets** depends on which window owns the keyboard:

- **From a focused pane** — a preview, a document, an issue, a note, a diff, a resource — `M` targets that leaf.
- **From either Workspaces list** (`workspace-list`, and `global-workspaces`, which the Sessions surface also reports for a focused Primary terminal) `M` targets the selected row's Primary terminal. Host focus decides which of the two the shared `global-workspaces` context means.
- **From a plugin content deck** the key is answered on the app's own structural rung, so it targets the focused passive leaf and never the primary plugin leaf underneath.

**Bound contexts** (all feature-gated on `pane_move`): `workspace-list`, `workspace-preview`, `workspace-doc`, `workspace-issue`, `workspace-note`, `workspace-diff`, `workspace-resource`, `global-workspaces`, `global-workspaces-doc`, `global-workspaces-issue`, `global-workspaces-note`, `global-workspaces-diff`, `global-workspaces-resource`. The app content decks report the same `workspace-*` context names for their own leaves and inherit these bindings.

**Not bound** in text-input, interactive-terminal, modal, or unrelated plugin browse contexts — `workspace-filter`, `workspace-interactive`, `workspace-doc-edit|search|find`, `global-workspaces-filter`, `global-workspaces-terminal`, `file-browser-tree`, `git-status`, `notes-list`, and the rest. Those contexts keep every printable key for themselves, and `internal/keymap/pane_move_parity_test.go` holds them to it.

**Why `M` and not `m`.** `m` is free in ten of the twelve pane contexts, and taken in exactly the two that would break parity: `global-workspaces-doc` spends it on `render`, and `global-workspaces` (what a focused Primary terminal reports on the Sessions surface) spends it on `merge-workflow`. One key must mean one thing in every pane, so a key that works in ten and not the other two is not a candidate. `M` is bound nowhere else except `git-status` (`stash-pop`), a plugin browse context that is never a pane leaf.

**A pane with nowhere to go has no entry.** A tree with a single leaf offers neither the key's modal nor the header's `⊞`: `PlanMove` refuses every destination on it, so both would open onto a layout that cannot change. The button appears when a second pane does.

**The agent's half of the same capability is `sidecar layout move`** over the same planner, with `--to left|right|up|down` compiling through the identical direction rule. See `.claude/skills/ui-features/SKILL.md` and `docs/reference/cli.md`.

### Interactive Mode

| Key | Command |
|-----|---------|
| `ctrl+\` | exit |
| `ctrl+]` | attach (`tmux_full_attach`, default off) |
| `ctrl+t` | toggle a terminal split beside the preview (`workspace_terminal_panel`, default on) |
| `ctrl+shift+f` | search complete terminal history |
| `alt+c` | copy |
| `super+c` | copy (Cmd+C, when the emulator passes it through) |
| `alt+v` | paste |

### Document Pane

An unmodified click on a resolvable file path in workspace or shell terminal
output opens it beside that terminal. A second click appends a tab; a path
that is already open is focused (and `path:line` jumps). Click a drawn tab
to select it. The header is only the tab strip: each label is the relative
path, left-truncated so the filename end always wins. Document panes are
enabled by default; `--disable-feature=workspace_doc_panes` opts out for a
launch and also disables Diff (no pane tree). `shift`-drag and `alt`-drag remain terminal selection gestures.

The global Workspaces view uses the same tab strip and the same click / `{`
/ `}` / `x` keys. Those tabs stay in memory for the selected row.

`q` / `esc` hide the pane and remember the tab set for this shell or
workspace. `x` on the last tab forgets the set. Switching surfaces or
relaunching onto the same surface restores open files, the active tab,
render mode, wrap, scroll, and split ratio. `,` / `.` cycle Diff target
tabs only while a Diff leaf is focused; they do not cycle document tabs.

| Key | Command | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `j` / `down` | scroll-down | Scroll down |
| `k` / `up` | scroll-up | Scroll up |
| `ctrl+d` / `ctrl+u` | page-down / page-up | Scroll half a page |
| `g` / `G` | cursor-top / cursor-bottom | Jump to start / end |
| `/` | search-content | Search within this file (in-pane bar; same feature as the Files plugin's `/`) |
| `e` | edit | Edit this file inline (tmux PTY editor in the pane body; `features.tmux_inline_edit`) |
| `ctrl+p` | find-file | Find a file by name in this pane (modal scoped to the pane) |
| `f` | search-project | Search the project in this pane (modal scoped to the pane) |
| `x` | close-tab | Close the active tab. Last tab closes the pane and forgets the set |
| `{` / `}` | prev-tab / next-tab | Previous / next file tab |
| `m` | render | Toggle rendered/raw markdown (markdown only; no-op otherwise) |
| `w` | toggle-wrap | Toggle line wrap |
| `I` | info | File info modal |
| `ctrl+r` | reveal | Reveal in the OS file manager |
| `Y` | yank-path | Copy the relative path |
| `+` / `-` | resize-pane-grow / resize-pane-shrink | Resize the workspace split |
| `tab` / `shift+tab` | next-pane / prev-pane | Move focus between sidebar, terminal, and document |
| `q` / `esc` | close | Hide the pane. Tabs stay remembered for this surface |

While a pane search is open (`workspace-doc-search`) it owns every key in
the pane: `esc` closes it, `enter` loads the hit in the active tab, and
`shift+enter` opens it in a new tab.

Inline edit (`e`) opens the same tmux-PTY editor the Files plugin uses, sized
to the pane body, on both pane surfaces (`workspace-doc-edit` and the global
browser's document pane). While a session is live every key is the editor's —
`ctrl+\` or `esc esc` exit it — and clicking outside the pane raises the
save / discard / cancel confirmation instead of leaving the buffer behind.

In-file search (`/`) is a third surface, drawn by `internal/docview` as one
row inside the pane, and it owns every key while it is up
(`workspace-doc-find`, `global-workspaces-doc-find`): `enter` commits,
`n` / `N` step matches, `esc` closes. It dismisses when the pane loses focus.
While it is up it also keeps `n` away from the pane switcher, which is asked
only after the pane's own input surfaces decline.

### Diff Pane

`d` / `show-diff` on the Workspaces list or preview opens a working-tree Diff
leaf beside the terminal. The leaf is not a root context: `q` / `esc` hide it.
`{` / `}` cycle Diff target tabs while the leaf is focused; `,` / `.` step
next/prev file inside the view, and `>` / `<` step next/prev change inside a
file (this pair was `n` / `N` until the pane switcher took `n` in every content
pane).

**One rule everywhere: `{` / `}` is always "cycle the tabs of the thing I am
looking at."** Document, issue, File Browser and Diff leaves all obey it. The
Diff pane is the only surface with a second navigation axis — the files inside
the active target — and that axis gets its own pair, `,` / `.`.

The earlier arrangement was the reverse (`{` / `}` = file, `,` / `.` = tab), on
the reasoning that in-view file jumping is the more frequent act in a diff and
so deserved the better-known keys. That reasoning was sound in isolation and
wrong in aggregate: it made the diff the one place in Sidecar where `}` did not
mean "next tab", so the cost was paid on every context switch into and out of
the diff, by everyone, forever — while the benefit accrued only inside the diff.
Consistency of a key's *meaning* across surfaces beats optimality of its
*assignment* on one surface. If you are tempted to re-optimise a key for a
single pane again, that is the trade to weigh.

| Key | Command | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `d` | show-diff | Open working-tree Diff leaf (list and preview) |
| `q` / `esc` | close | Hide the pane. Tabs stay remembered for this surface |
| `x` | close-tab | Close the active tab. Last tab forgets the pane |
| `{` / `}` | prev-tab / next-tab | Previous / next Diff target tab |
| `,` / `.` | prev-file / next-file | Previous / next file in this target |
| `Y` | yank-id | Copy the target identity (`wt` / `c:…` / `r:…`) |
| `tab` / `shift+tab` | next-pane / prev-pane | Move focus between sidebar, terminal, and content |
| `\` | toggle-sidebar | Toggle sidebar visibility |

Moving around inside the viewer. These are the shared viewer's own keys
(`internal/workspacediff/keys.go`); they are registered in `bindings.go` for both
`workspace-diff` and `global-workspaces-diff` so the footer, help and palette show
them, and the viewer answers them before keymap dispatch.

| Key | Command | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `l` / `right` / `enter` | diff-open | Open the selected file's diff, or a commit's file list |
| `j` / `down` | diff-down / diff-scroll-down | Next item in the list; scroll the diff body |
| `k` / `up` | diff-up / diff-scroll-up | Previous item; scroll the diff body up |
| `h` / `left` | diff-back | Back to the file list (scrolls sideways first when panned) |
| `g` / `G` | diff-top / diff-bottom | Jump to the top / bottom |
| `ctrl+d` / `pgdown` | diff-page-down | Page down |
| `ctrl+u` / `pgup` | diff-page-up | Page up |
| `v` | toggle-diff-view | Cycle unified → side-by-side → full-file |
| `z` | toggle-diff-scope | Cycle working tree → commits → aggregate |
| `>` / `<` | diff-next-change | Next / previous change (full-file mode) |
| `f` | file-picker | Open the file picker (project pane only) |

### Issue Pane

An unmodified click on a `td-…` link in workspace or shell terminal
output opens it beside that terminal. A second click appends a tab; an
ID that is already open is focused. Click a drawn tab to select it.
The header is only the tab strip: each label is the issue ID plus
headline, truncated at the end so the ID stays visible. There is no
close chip. Footer hints are Tab× Tab← Tab→.

The global Workspaces view uses the same tab strip and the same click /
`{` / `}` / `x` keys. Those tabs stay in memory for the selected row
and are not written to disk. `q` / `esc` and last-`x` forget that row's
set.

In project Workspaces, `q` / `esc` hide the pane and remember the tab
set for this shell or workspace. `x` on the last tab forgets the set.
Switching surfaces or relaunching onto the same surface restores open
issues, the active tab, and each tab's scroll. Parent and subtask
`enter` uses the same open-or-focus path.

File tabs keep left-truncated paths so the filename survives. Issue
tabs keep the ID visible and truncate the headline.

| Key | Command | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `j` / `k` | scroll-down / scroll-up | Scroll down / up |
| `down` / `up` | | Walk parent, siblings, and subtasks |
| `ctrl+d` / `ctrl+u` | page-down / page-up | Scroll half a page |
| `g` / `G` | cursor-top / cursor-bottom | Jump to start / end |
| `x` | close-tab | Close the active tab. Last tab closes the pane and forgets the set |
| `{` / `}` | prev-tab / next-tab | Previous / next issue tab |
| `enter` | open-item | Open or focus the selected parent or subtask as a tab |
| `y` | yank-issue | Copy the issue as markdown |
| `Y` | yank-issue-key | Copy the issue ID |
| `tab` / `shift+tab` | next-pane / prev-pane | Move focus between sidebar, terminal, document, and issue |
| `q` / `esc` | close | Hide the pane. Tabs stay remembered for this surface |

## Notes Plugin

Contexts: `notes-list` (root), `notes-preview`, `notes-editor`, `notes-search`, `notes-info`, `notes-task-modal`, `notes-delete-modal`, `notes-inline-edit`.

The built-in editor is modeless: printable keys type. Selection and undo use modifier chords so `v`, `u`, `y`, `d`, `x`, and `p` stay letters.

### Built-in editor (`notes-editor`)

| Key | Command | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `shift+arrows` / `shift+home` / `shift+end` | select-* | Extend a source-coordinate selection |
| `alt+s` | select-toggle | Set or clear the selection anchor; ordinary movement then extends |
| `alt+a` | select-all | Select the whole note |
| `super+a` | select-all | Select the whole note when the terminal delivers Cmd; `alt+a` is the portable advertised fallback |
| `super+up` / `super+down` | note-start / note-end | Move to the start / end of the note when delivered |
| `shift+super+up` / `shift+super+down` | select-note-start / select-note-end | Extend selection to the start / end of the note when delivered |
| `alt+c` | copy-note | Copy the selection, or the whole note if none |
| `alt+x` | cut | Cut the selection |
| backspace / delete / type / paste | — | Replace the selection (one undo unit) |
| `ctrl+z` | undo-edit | Undo the last edit unit |
| `ctrl+y` / `ctrl+shift+z` | redo-edit | Redo |
| `ctrl+s` | save | Save now; after leaving edit, retry a failed save from list, preview, or search |
| `esc` / `tab` | back / switch-pane | Leave edit and persist |

The tmux/`$EDITOR` pane (`e`) keeps vim's own undo and selection.

In the list and read-only preview, `ctrl+y` copies the selected note ID. In the
built-in editor it remains redo, and in the tmux/`$EDITOR` pane it is forwarded
unchanged. Enter and note-body clicks follow `plugins.notes.defaultEditor`;
`i`, `e`, and `E` remain explicit built-in, in-pane, and external editor paths.

## TD Monitor Plugin

Contexts: `td-monitor` (root), `td-board`, `td-kanban`, `td-modal`, `td-stats`, `td-search`, `td-confirm`, `td-epic-tasks`, `td-parent-epic`, `td-handoffs`.

Shortcuts are defined in TD's `pkg/monitor/keymap/` and auto-exported. The
context *names* come from there too — td names its own context and
`monitor/keymap.ContextToSidecar` spells it for sidecar — so any sidecar-side
binding on a `td-*` context is a copy of someone else's constant.
`tdmonitor.TestBrowseContextsCarryThePaneSwitcherEntry` derives them from the
upstream constants so a rename in td fails a test here rather than silently
unbinding a key.

`ctrl+n` opens the pane switcher in `td-monitor`, `td-board` and `td-kanban`.
See "The Pane Switcher Is Reachable From Every Pane" for why `td-modal` is not
among them.

## Tasks Plugin

Contexts: `tasks-list`, `tasks-detail`, `tasks-response`, `tasks-response-detail`
(the four **root** contexts), plus every overlay Tasks reports —
`tasks-filter`, `tasks-form`, `tasks-modal`, `tasks-picker`, `tasks-prompt`,
`tasks-task-edit`, `tasks-agent-activity` and the rest.

Shortcuts are defined in Tasks' `pkg/tui` and auto-exported, and the context
names come from there verbatim (`tasksui.FocusContext`). Root-ness is sidecar's
own judgement (`internal/plugins/tasks/routing.go`) and it fails conservative:
anything unknown is treated as an overlay, so sidecar's global keys do not fire
underneath one.

`ctrl+n` opens the pane switcher in the four root contexts and nowhere else —
in an overlay, `BlocksGlobalKeys` has already handed the key to the tab.

## Project Switcher

## Known Conflicts and Design Decisions

Key conflicts exist across plugins (e.g., `d` = delete in file-browser, diff in git, delete-session in conversations). See `references/assessment.md` for the full inconsistency analysis, vim alignment audit, mnemonic analysis, and proposed improvement plan.

### Shift Modifier Convention (Current)

- `s`/`S`: stage / stage-all (git)
- `u`/`U`: unstage / unstage-all (git)
- `d`/`D`: diff / discard (git), delete/- (file-browser)
- `y`/`Y`: yank item / yank path
- `n`/`N`: next-match / prev-match (search contexts)
